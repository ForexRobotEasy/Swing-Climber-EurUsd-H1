# Swing Climber EurUsd H1 Expert Advisor

## Product Description

Swing Climber EurUsd H1 is a fully automated trading system that aims to capitalize on swing trading opportunities in the EUR/USD currency pair on the H1 timeframe. It uses a combination of technical indicators to identify potential swing levels and enters trades accordingly. 

The expert advisor has the following customizable input parameters:

- Take Profit (TP): The desired take profit level in pips.
- Stop Loss (SL): The desired stop loss level in pips.
- Lot Size: The trading lot size.
- Custom Exit Times: Option to enable customization of exit times.
- Exit Hour: The default exit hour if custom exit times are enabled.

The expert advisor works by monitoring the price movement and checking if there is an open trade. If there is no open trade, it calculates the daily swing levels using the highest and lowest prices of the past 24 hours. 

If the price crosses above the swing high level, a buy trade is opened with the specified lot size, take profit, and stop loss. If the price crosses below the swing low level, a sell trade is opened with the same parameters. 

Once a trade is opened, the expert advisor monitors the trade's status. If the trade is closed, it resets the trade variables and allows for new trades to be executed.
